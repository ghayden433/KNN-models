Thought it would be fun to write my own K nearest neighbors classification model
using the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/159/magic+gamma+telescope 

v1.0
 - compares each element in the test set to every element of the training set
 - takes a very long time and is very inefficient
 - took about 10 hours to get through 2000 elements with about 80.5% accuracy
